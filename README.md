# Skeley-Wars
My exploration into the whole process of making games! In month my goal is to learn about the design, programming, art, and sound parts that go into making a video game! The game will be aimed to be like advance wars and my goal is to complete a basic level in a month!

First week will be developing a basic game desing document to layout the goals of the project and the MVP that I am aiming for. It will layout out the eventual goals that I will aim to complete once the month has been overwith as well as the general theme and layout for what the art direction will be. I will also work completing a basic level that the player can move units through and trigger combats with! As well as a basic level design that I will use when developing future levels.

Second week will be developing the more advance options that will take place for gameplay, the goal is to allow players to capture strategic points, as well as they can then build units from them. Also I will add a couple of unit types that will have different benefits into each other. The stretch goal for this week would be to have a basic AI implemented but thats a stretch since I haven't worked with AI yet!

Third week will be working on the level soundtrack! So I will be learning about how music is implemented in Unity as well as learning the basics about how to make music! I will aim for basic sound effects as well as a background song to play during the game! I will also do some bug fixing during this time and any finishing touches to goal of the programming side.

Final week is designing my own units and art for the game, the goal is to fully move to my own units with animations being set up for the units. This will as be the final touches on any of the previous parts that I have worked on with the goal to have a fully playable level from start to end with hopefully an AI for the player to face or 1 on 1 if you wanted to play with a friend.

Stretch Goals:
- Fully Working AI
- Research Buildings with unit upgrades
- Different Unit Models for Factions
- Leaders with maybe hero units
- Multiple Maps
